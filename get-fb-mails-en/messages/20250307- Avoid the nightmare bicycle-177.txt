*Avoid the nightmare bicycle *
In my opinion, one of the most important ideas in product design is to 
avoid the “nightmare bicycle”.
Imagine a bicycle where the product manager said: “people don’t get math 
so we can’t have numbered gears.

We need labeled buttons for gravel mode, downhill mode, …”
This is the hypothetical “nightmare bicycle” that Andrea diSessa 
imagines in his book Changing Minds.
As he points out: it would be terrible! We’d lose the intuitive 
understanding of how to use the gears to solve any situation we encounter.

Which mode do you use for gravel + downhill?
It turns out, anyone can understand numbered gears totally fine after a 
bit of practice. People are capable!

Along the same lines: one of the worst misconceptions in product design 
is that a microwave needs to have
a button for every thing you could possibly cook: “popcorn”, “chicken”, 
“potato”, “frozen vegetable”, bla bla bla.
You really don’t! You can just have a time (and power) button. People 
will figure out how to cook stuff.

Good designs expose systematic structure; they lean on their users’ 
ability to understand this structure and apply it to new situations.

*We were born for this.*

Bad designs paper over the structure with superficial labels that hide 
the underlying system,
inhibiting their users’ ability to actually build a clear model in their 
heads.

Minds[https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262541329/changing-minds/ 
<https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262541329/changing-minds/>] is one of the 
best books ever written
about design and computational thinking, you should go read it.
