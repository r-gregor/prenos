How To Save Commands In Terminal And Use Them On Demand
   March 4, 2017

   Let us say you’re searching for a specific command to solve a specific issue on your Linux system.
   After a bit of Google search, you find it on a website or a blog, and you execute the command. Voila!
   The problem is solved. You’re happy now and continue your work with great satisfaction. After a few
   weeks or months, you encountered with the same issue on another Linux system. You remember solving
   the same issue few week ago, but you completely forgot the full command. Oops! You run reverse search
   on your Terminal by running ‘CTRL+R’ from the Terminal, and you search through your browser history.
   But your mind is completely blank and you couldn’t recall the exact command. This is what I have
   faced numerous times. Every time, I spend a lot of time web to search for commands. Not any more!
   Meet ‘Keep’, a personal shell command keeper.

   ‘Keep’ utility allows you to keep the most frequently used and most important commands in your
   Terminal and you can use them later without having to search on websites or man pages. Also, you
   don’t need to memorize the lengthy commands. Keep utility will save your important and frequently
   used commands in Terminal itself. You can retrieve and execute them at any time. More importantly,
   you can sync the saved commands across multiple systems and also save all commands on a remote
   system. Seems useful, isn’t it?

   To put this simply, ‘Keep’ utility
     * Can keep all your commands in the Terminal itself with brief description.
     * Allows you to search the saved commands using powerful patterns.
     * Allows you to sync saved commands on multiple systems on the network.
     * Allows you to save commands on any remote server on the network.

   In this brief guide, I will show you how to install and use ‘Keep’ in Unix-like systems.

Install ‘Keep’ On Linux
   The easiest and official way to install ‘Keep’ is by using PIP. Pip is the package manager that
   allows you to install applications written using Python programming language.

   Pip can be installed on Arch Linux and its derivatives as shown below:
sudo pacman -S python-pip

   On Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint:
sudo apt-get install python-pip

   On RHEL, Fedora, CentOS:

   Enable EPEL repository first.
sudo yum install epel-release

   Or,
sudo dnf install epel-release

   Then, install pip using command:
sudo yum install python-pip

   Or,
sudo dnf install python-pip

   On SUSE/openSUSE:
sudo zypper install python-pip

   Once pip installed, run the following command to install ‘Keep’. The following command is same for
   all Linux distributions!
sudo pip install keep

Save Commands In Terminal And Use Them On Demand Using ‘Keep’ Utility

   ‘Keep’ usage is very simple. The typical syntax of ‘keep’ utility is:
keep [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

   It’s time to see some practical examples. Look at the following command.
find -iname '*.txt' -exec cp {} /home/sk/Downloads/ \;

   This command will find and copy all files that ends with extension .txt. and save them in
   /home/sk/Downloads/ directory. I have very poor memory. After a few  weeks or months, I couldn’t
   remember this command. I bet some of you can’t remember this kind of lengthy commands after some
   time.

   So, what I am going to do is just save this command in my Terminal using ‘keep’ utility.

   First, we need to initialize the ‘keep’ environment.

   To do so, run:
keep init

   The above command will ask you to enter your Email. It is the unique username to you.  You can input
   anything unique to you. You can choose to not register this time and later start the process by using
   keep register command. You can use Keep CLI without registering if you do not intend to use the
   server for storing or fetching your commands. It generates a 255 bit password for you. It is then
   stored inside your ~/.keep/.credentials file.

   Sample output would be:
   [INS: :INS]
Initializing environment in ~/.keep directory
...OK
Proceed to register? [Y/n]: y
Your credentials will be saved in the ~/.keep directory.
Email: admin@ostechnix.com
Repeat for confirmation: admin@ostechnix.com
Verifying with existing users...
Generated password for admin@ostechnix.com

pNLs
Credentials file saved at ~/.keep/.credentials.json

   Save a new command
   To save a new command, just run:
keep new

   Enter the full command you’d like to save and hit ENTER. Then, provide the description of the command
   and press ENTER key.

   Sample output:
Command: find -iname '*.txt' -exec cp {} /home/sk/Downloads/ \;
Description : find and copy all files that ends with extension .txt

   Now, the command has been saved. Similarly, you can save any number of commands using ‘keep new’
   command.

   View the saved commands
   To view all saved commands, just run:
keep list

   This command will display the list of saved commands with description.

   Sample output:
Command Description
-------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
$ find -iname '*.txt' -exec cp {} /home/sk/Downloads/ \; find and copy all files that ends with extension .txt

   Search for the saved commands
   You can search any saved commands with its description. You don’t have to specify the complete
   description. Look at the following example.

   keep grep “find and copy”

   You will see saved commands matching to the search term. I got the following command for the above
   command.
$ find -iname '*.txt' -exec cp {} /home/sk/Downloads/ \; :: find and copy all files that ends with extension .
txt

   Execute the saved commands
   To execute the saved commands at any time, simply run with saved command’s description as shown
   below:
keep run "find and copy"

   You will be asked whether to execute or not the command. Just press ‘Y’ to run the command:
Execute

find -iname '*.txt' -exec cp {} /home/sk/Downloads/ \;

? [Y/n]: y

   Sync Saved commands with another system
   If you have got another system, install ‘keep’ on it as I described in the “Install Keep” section.
   Then, run “keep init” (without quotes, of course) command and skip registration. Copy your
   ~/.keep/.credentials file over to the target computer in the same location. Finally, run the
   following command to retrieve all the saved commands.
keep pull

   To store the commands on the remote server, use ‘keep push’ command.

   Delete saved commands

   To delete a saved command, simply run:
keep rm

   Enter the command to remove and hit ENTER. The specified command will deleted from the Keep cache.
Command to remove: find -iname '*.txt' -exec cp {} /home/sk/Downloads/ \;
Command successfully removed!

keep --help

   ‘Keep’ utility is really useful when it comes to dealing with numerous commands everyday. It is quite
   difficult to remember all commands. In such cases, Keep utility might be useful.
