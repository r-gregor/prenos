Kill al mintty windos at once:
	kill -9 -1
	
	
Explanation:
kill allows you to send signals to processes you specify. By default, the TERM signal is sent. To send the
TERM signal to a process with a PID of n use:
	(sudo) kill n

When you put a - in front of n you tell the system to terminate every process with a PID above n.
	sudo kill -9 -1
Will kill every process with a PID above 9 first, then terminate everything with a PID above 1, effectively
killing all but PID 0, which is initiated by the kernel at boot. This is why you got a black screen.
