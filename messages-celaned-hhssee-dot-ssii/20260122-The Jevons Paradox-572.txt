The Jevons Paradox____

In 1865, the English economist William Stanley Jevons observed something 
counterintuitive about coal____

consumption. As steam engines became more efficient and required less 
coal per unit of work, you’d____

expect overall coal consumption to decrease. Instead it increased 
dramatically. The improved efficiency____

made coal economically viable for applications that previously couldn’t 
justify the cost. More efficient____

use of a resource leads to more total consumption of that resource, not 
less.____

__ __

This pattern, now called Jevons Paradox, shows up everywhere. More fuel 
efficient cars lead to more____

driving. Faster internet leads to more bandwidth consumption ...____

__ __

 From Google:____

Jevons Paradox states that as technology makes a resource more efficient 
to use (like more fuel-efficient____

cars), the overall consumption of that resource actually increases 
because it becomes cheaper, leading to____

more widespread and frequent use, rather than conservation. First 
observed with coal in the 19th century,____

it explains how efficiency gains in one area (e.g., steam engines) drive 
demand for the underlying____

resource (coal) through increased application, creating more overall 
demand and consumption, a concept____

now relevant to AI and energy use.____

__ __

How it works____

   - Efficiency decreases unit cost:____

     A new technology uses less of a resource per unit of output (e.g., 
a more efficient lightbulb uses____

     less electricity for the same light).____

__ __

   - Lower cost boosts demand:____

     This efficiency makes the service cheaper, so people use it more 
(e.g., leaving more lights on)____

     or find new uses for it (e.g., powering data centers for AI).____

__ __

   - Total consumption rises:____

     Because the resource is used so much more widely, the total amount 
consumed goes up, even though____

     each individual use is more efficient.____

__ __

Examples____

   - Coal:____

     More efficient steam engines led to more factories and broader 
industrial use, dramatically increasing____

     total coal demand.____

__ __

   - Computers & AI:____

     Energy-efficient computers have fueled the growth of data centers 
and widespread use of smartphones,____

     leading to a massive surge in overall digital energy demand.____

__ __

   - Roads:____

     Adding highway lanes can induce more driving, leading to the same 
or worse congestion (traffic)____

     as people switch from public transit or carpooling.____

__ __

Significance:____

   - Policy challenge:____

     It challenges the assumption that energy efficiency alone is enough 
to address resource depletion____

     or climate change, suggesting that rebound effects can negate 
conservation efforts.____

__ __

   - Modern relevance:____

     It's a key concept in understanding the environmental impacts of 
new technologies like artificial____

     intelligence, where efficiency gains could spur massive new usage.____
