Several mathematicians are consistently ranked among the greatest of all time, including Archimedes, Isaac Newton, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Leonhard Euler, and Bernhard Riemann. These individuals made profound contributions to various fields of mathematics and physics, shaping the course of scientific development. 
Here's a more detailed look at some of these influential figures:

Archimedes:
A Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer, Archimedes is often considered one of the greatest mathematicians of antiquity. His work included foundational concepts in geometry, calculus, and mechanics. 

Isaac Newton:
A towering figure in the history of science, Newton made groundbreaking contributions to physics, astronomy, and mathematics. His development of calculus, along with Leibniz, revolutionized the field.

Carl Friedrich Gauss:
A German mathematician and scientist who made significant contributions to number theory, statistics, algebra, geodesy, and other fields.

Leonhard Euler:
A highly prolific Swiss mathematician and physicist who made important discoveries in calculus, graph theory, number theory, and other areas. He is considered one of the most influential mathematicians of all time. 

Bernhard Riemann:
A German mathematician who made transformative contributions to analysis, number theory, and geometry. His work laid the foundation for modern complex analysis and differential geometry. 

Euclid:
Known as the "Father of Geometry," his "Elements" is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics, laying the foundation for geometry as a rigorous, deductive science. 

Other mathematicians who are frequently cited as being among the greatest include: 
    Euclid
    Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
    Srinivasa Ramanujan
    Emmy Noether
    David Hilbert
    Alan Turing
    Joseph-Louis Lagrange
    Georg Cantor
    Évariste Galois 

These mathematicians, among others, have shaped the landscape of mathematics and continue to inspire and influence mathematicians today.
